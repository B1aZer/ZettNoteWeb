## General

[README for previous version](./README-v.0.1.md)

After trial and error it became clear that Web app is not best suited for Zettelkasten
method or Wiki notes in simple terms. App should has 2 attributes: quick to write, quick
to search. And while web links is good enough solution for latter, there is currently no web editor
available that would be as performant as desktop editor such as vim in regards of writing
and navigation. [See for details](https://github.com/B1aZer/ZettNote). So the scope of this app is switched to creating quick notes
in Zettel system.

## Goal

 - [ ] Minimal responsive UI for note creation
 - [ ] Codemirror with markdown syntax
 - [ ] Note saved to shared storage (Dropbox)
 - [ ] Offline support
